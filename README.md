(Code borrowed from: http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/code/test/)

Why?
----
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) felt too mainstream :)

Terminator
----------
To use the Terminator theme, copy the file to `.config/terminator/config`.

GNOME Terminal
--------------
Run either `gnome-termina-set-dark.sh` or `gnome-termina-set-light.sh`. The only difference is that the foreground/background colors get swapped.

gedit
-----
Later.
